Project for the new marking criteria at FAST-NUCES.

Project explains how MCA works relative to mean and standard deviation. It generates random numbers in a certain range and displays the values itsels as well as the mean and standard deviation.

Then the MCA is displayed. It helps in explaining how much the MCA can differ from the Mean itself depending on the standard deviation.

Values are integers as final values used to calculate MCA are rounded off values of the grand total marks obtained.
